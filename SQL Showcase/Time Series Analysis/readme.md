The examples in this time series analysis use a data set of monthly US retail sales from the Monthly Retail Trade Report: Retail and Food Services Sales: Excel (1992â€“present), available on the Census.gov website.

The data was published monthly from 1992 to 2020 and includes both total sales as well as details for subcategories of retail sales. This analysis will use the unadjusted sales numbers, since one of the goals is analyzing seasonality. Sales figures are in millions of US dollars.

I import the csv file into SQL Server database using **SQL Server Import** extension on Azure Data Studio. Then I analyze the data and save the queries as a Jupyter Notebook file.
