# SQL Project using Movie Database
- The movie database I used is taken from [DatabaseStar Website](https://www.databasestar.com/sample-data-sql/)
- The scripts to create and populate tables can be found at [this github](https://github.com/bbrumm/databasestar/tree/main/sample_databases/sample_db_movies). I use SQL Server for this project. 
- Some scripts from the original author have issues with the data so I fixed/cleaned where necessary and uploaded to this folder in .sql format. The sql queries and analysis is written in .ipynb format.
- A detailed explanation about the database can be found [here](https://www.databasestar.com/sample-database-movies/)
